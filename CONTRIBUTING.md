# Contributing
- Create issues for major changes, preferably split into a checklist of smaller tasks.
- Create a new feature branch when working on an issue.
- Minor fixes do not need issues, but should still be done on new branches.
- When merging a branch into main, close any corresponding issue. A branch may not be merged into main if it corresponds to an issue but does not fully close it.
